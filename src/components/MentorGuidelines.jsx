      "Keep all communication with students on HappyResearch or in email threads that include the student's parent or our team. Don't exchange personal phone numbers or social media contacts with students.",
      "Parents may observe any session. Never discourage a student from sharing what happens in sessions with their family.",

    title: "4. Be respectful and inclusive",

          Every HappyResearch mentor agrees to these guidelines. They keep our
