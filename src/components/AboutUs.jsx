            When I was a student, my mind was filled with research ideas and
            curiosity. I was eager to explore, create, and contribute — but I
            struggled to find mentors who could guide me. Much of my time was
            spent searching for opportunities, navigating challenges alone, and
            trying to figure things out without support.
          </p>
          <p
            style={{
              fontSize: 15,
              color: "#555",
              lineHeight: 1.9,
              marginBottom: 16,
            }}
          >
            Years later, after becoming a professor myself, I began meeting many
            young students who shared the same passion for knowledge and
            discovery. They reached out hoping to join my lab as interns or
            volunteers, excited to experience real research for the first time.
            Whenever possible, I welcomed them. At one point, my research group
            grew to become the largest lab in our department.
          </p>
          <p
            style={{
              fontSize: 15,

              lineHeight: 1.9,
              marginBottom: 16,
            }}
          >
            Over time, however, I realized that my own time, energy, and
            expertise were limited. No single professor can mentor every student
            or cover every research direction. Yet there were still so many
            students searching for guidance, meaningful projects, and
            opportunities to grow.

            How can we help more students access mentorship for the research
